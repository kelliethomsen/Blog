Confidence. ‘The quality of being certain of your abilities or having trust in people, plans, or the
future’ – Cambridge Dictionary.

It is a feeling we all desire and crave to hold. Knowing that our future self has our back or that we
can tackle anything and come out the other side safely.

It’s going after that dream job, returning to school, saying no more to things that don’t align with us
or our goals, and so on… but how do we ‘get’ confidence.

According to Dr Ivan Joseph, during a 2012 Tedx Talk, he stated that confidence is a skill he believes
can be trained. The way this can be done is through persistence, persistence, persistence. You may try
something and face adversity, but if you are persistent and devoted to achieving something, you must
keep going. Soon enough, that new and scary thing is second nature… that’s where confidence is
generally found.

Your mind is also a powerful tool; what you constantly tell yourself becomes your reality. If you
constantly tell yourself you aren’t worthy, enough or confident, you’ll show up as if you aren’t. That’s
where the power of affirmations can come to help change those negative thought patterns and
identify when you are talking down to yourself.

Let’s break it down. Affirmations are one of the best tools for manifesting what you want and cocreating
your reality.
“I am the greatest.” – Muhammad Ali

“I believe you can speak things into existence.” – Jay Z

“Am I good enough? Yes, I am,” – Michelle Obama.

Is there a science behind all of this? YES! One of the key psychological theories behind positive
affirmations is the self-affirmation theory (Steele, 1988). Self-affirmation theory has led to
neuroscientific research, which focuses on investigating potential changes in the brain when
individuals self-affirm in positive ways. According to Cascio et al. (2015), MRI evidence suggests that
certain neural pathways are increased when individuals practice self-affirmation tasks. Here are some
additional benefits!

1. Self-affirmations decrease health-deteriorating stress (Sherman et al., 2009; Critcher & Dunning,
2015)

2. They may help perceive otherwise “threatening” messages with less resistance, including
interventions (Logel & Cohen, 2012);

3. They can help dismiss harmful health messages, responding instead to change for the better
(Harris et al., 2007).

I have been saying, “All the money I spend will return to me x10”, particularly while saving for a house
deposit. While studying, I say, “I am a coder; I am destined to study data science”, in times when I
feel the most stressed. I also learnt that if you use wording such as ‘I don’t want to be shy’, you will
still be shy because you are not being specific about exactly what you are. Ok, you don’t want to be
shy, but what do you want to be then???

I also want to cover how you can create your affirmations. It’s quite an essay process, but the key
here is to be specific and say it as if that goal has already happened.

“I am a data scientist working at X in my hometown; I have the flexibility of starting early and
finishing early, and im on X/ year”.

Use phrases like “I am, I have”, and make sure all verbs are present or past tense.

I find reflection another powerful. Think about all the amazing things you have in your life right now,
big or small. Think of a time when you took a step outside your comfort one to get these things,
whether it was a one-off action or a long time of hard work and persistence. For that, you should give
yourself a high five right now!

You have confidence in yourself (internally and externally); you just need to unleash it. Remind
yourself that you are worthy, loved and enough!

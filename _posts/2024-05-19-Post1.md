title: "5 easy codes to clean your excel data faster."
---

Coding can be a bit of a mystery to some people, especially those not studying; however, it can be super effective for productivity in its simplest forms. Even better, these codes can be used to clean up our everyday excel spreadsheets easily. Minimise the manual labour with these five simple codes that can help clean up excel spreadsheet data in Rstudio. The good thing about Rstudio for people not fully across coding is that itâ€™s FREE to download, and there is a tonne of free cheat sheets to help you out. Check out the link here. Refer to the table below of the excel spreadsheet data: air quality (in CSV format).

### Tables

NOTE: if you see # in front of a sentence, that is a comment within the code.

## Getting Started in RStudio

Now I could go in-depth here on how to get Rstudio up and running, but I want to focus on the tips and tricks for this series. There is a tonne of information to help you get started, however, I am aiming to create a post on getting started on R studio, so stay tuned! For now, I found Datacamp a helpful starting place for getting started in the R language, so check out that below.

## Bring in the Data

```R
airq<-read.csv('airq.csv')
```

## 1. NA to Blank

```R
airq_NA2B <- airq #renaming the dataset
airq_NA2B[is.na(airq_NA2B)] <- ""
airq_NA2B #this prints the dataset
```
The result is in the table below:

Ozone                 | Solar.R               | Wind                  | Temp
--------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------
41                    | 190                   | 7.4                   | 67
36                    | 118                   | 8                     | 72
12                    | 149                   | 12.6                  | 74
18                    | 313                   | 11.5                  | 62
                      |                       | 14.3                  | 56
28                    |                       | 14.9                  | 66
23                    | 299                   | 8.6                   | 65
19                    | 99                    | 13.8                  | 59
8                     | 19                    | 20.1                  | 61
                      | 194                   | 8.6                   | 69

## 2. Blanks to the mean of the dataset

Sometimes you may want to fill in the blanks with an average based on your data, but you can do this in two ways. The first one is adding an average value based on the full dataset. This code uses other variables to predict missing entries, known as predictive imputation.

```R
airq_PI <- airq #rename for new code
model <- lm(Solar.R ~ Wind + Temp, data = airq_PI) # linear model:
lm() automatically omits rows with empty values
I <- is.na(airq_PI$Solar.R) # Identify records with missing values
airq_PI$Solar.R[I] <- predict(model, newdata = airq_PI[I, ]) # Replace those missing values with the ones predicted by the model
```

So the following code used Wind and Temp variables to estimate the blank values in Solar.R. The
output is below:

Ozone                 | Solar.R               | Wind                  | Temp
--------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------
41                    | 190                   | 7.4                   | 67
36                    | 118                   | 8                     | 72
12                    | 149                   | 12.6                  | 74
18                    | 313                   | 11.5                  | 62
NA                    | 185.440602            | 14.3                  | 56
28                    | 106.105505            | 14.9                  | 66
23                    | 299                   | 8.6                   | 65
19                    | 99                    | 13.8                  | 59
8                     | 19                    | 20.1                  | 61
NA                    | 194                   | 8.6                   | 69

## 3. Blanks to the mean of the variable

Univariate imputation uses only values of the same variable (from other observations) to estimate blank values. The simplest method is replacing the missing value with a certain statistical measure, such as the mean or median of the non-missing values if the variable is numeric or the mode (most frequent value) if the variable is categorical.

```R
airq_UI <- airq #rename for new code
I <- is.na(airq_UI$Solar.R) # Identify records with NA values
airq_UI$Solar.R[I] <- mean(airq_UI$Solar.R, na.rm = TRUE) # Replace NA with the mean
```

Ozone                 | Solar.R               | Wind                  | Temp
--------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------
41                    | 190                   | 7.4                   | 67
36                    | 118                   | 8                     | 72
12                    | 149                   | 12.6                  | 74
18                    | 313                   | 11.5                  | 62
NA                    | 172.625               | 14.3                  | 56
28                    | 172.625               | 14.9                  | 66
23                    | 299                   | 8.6                   | 65
19                    | 99                    | 13.8                  | 59
8                     | 19                    | 20.1                  | 61
NA                    | 194                   | 8.6                   | 69

## 4. Remove blanks or a certain value observation

To conduct the next, you will install a package called dplyr. The dplyr package is a structure of data manipulation that provides a uniform set of verbs, which helps resolve the data manipulation hurdles. To get the package, complete the next two lines of code. After running, you can add the # symbol in front of the install function.

```R
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```

Once that is done, you can begin to do some filtering. The function is used to subset a data frame, retaining the rows that satisfy the specified conditions.

```R
filter()
airq_F1 <- airq %>%
filter(Solar.R!="")
```

The resulting output of the code is below:

Ozone                 | Solar.R               | Wind                  | Temp
--------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------
41                    | 190                   | 7.4                   | 67
36                    | 118                   | 8                     | 72
12                    | 149                   | 12.6                  | 74
18                    | 313                   | 11.5                  | 62
23                    | 299                   | 8.6                   | 65
19                    | 99                    | 13.8                  | 59
8                     | 19                    | 20.1                  | 61
NA                    | 194                   | 8.6                   | 69

```R
airq_F2 <- airq %>%
filter(Solar.R==149) #observation 3
```

The resulting output of the code is below:

Ozone                 | Solar.R               | Wind                  | Temp
--------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------
12                    | 149                   | 12.6                  | 74

Instead of ==, you could have != if you wish to select all observations not equal to 149.

## 5. Remove certain values based on a condition

```R
airq_F3 <- airq %>%
filter(Solar.R >= 150)
```

The resulting output of the code is below:

Ozone                 | Solar.R               | Wind                  | Temp
--------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------
41                    | 190                   | 7.4                   | 67
18                    | 313                   | 11.5                  | 62
23                    | 299                   | 8.6                   | 65
NA                    | 194                   | 8.6                   | 69

## Export Data

When ready to export your data, complete the following code. Feel free to call the CSV whatever you like.

```R
write.csv(airq_new, "airq_new.csv")
```
